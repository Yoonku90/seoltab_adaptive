At one point, Singaporean Sam became ill and needed to spend some time in the hospital, so the band took a break. However, we still met from time to time by using the video chat app. We talked about our lives and did what we could do to cheer Singaporean Sam up. Since he had to stay in the hospital on his birthday, the rest of us recorded his favorite song as his birthday present. When we played it for him, he laughed so hard that he cried. That was mainly because the song was sung by the worst singer in the band — me! It was good to see him laugh even though he was lying in his hospital bed. After Singaporean Sam recovered, we decided to write and record our own song. We called the song “Long-Distance Friendship,” and we posted it online. The song didn’t get much attention, but we were proud of what we had <u>achieved</u> together.`,
