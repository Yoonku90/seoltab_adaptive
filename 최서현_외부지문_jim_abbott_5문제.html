                    대화에서 짐 애벗은 "on my fourth birthday I was given a soccer ball by my father"라고 말한다. 즉, 네 번째 생일에 아버지로부터 축구공을 받았다고 설명하고 있다. 야구공이 아니라 축구공을 받았지만 축구를 좋아하지 않았고, 다른 아이들이 야구를 하는 것을 보고 야구를 시작하게 되었다. 따라서 ③번 "짐 애벗은 아버지가 야구공을 사주셔서 야구를 시작했다"는 내용과 일치하지 않는다.

                    이 인터뷰는 오른손 없이 태어났음에도 불구하고 올림픽 금메달과 메이저리그에서 성공을 거둔 짐 애벗의 이야기다. 그는 인생이 불공평하다고 느끼기보다는 긍정적인 태도를 유지했고("I was given many things in life"), 야구에 대한 열정으로 포기하지 않았다("If you really love something, you never want to say 'never'"). 따라서 역경을 긍정적인 태도와 열정으로 극복한 것이 핵심 주제다.

                    대화에는 짐 애벗의 아버지가 무엇을 하는 사람인지에 대한 정보가 전혀 언급되어 있지 않다. ①번은 다른 아이들처럼 되고 싶어서라고 설명되어 있고, ②번은 뉴욕 양키스라고 명시되어 있으며, ④번은 "Find something that you love and go after it"라고 조언하고 있고, ⑤번은 "I feel very lucky to help them"이라고 말하고 있다. 따라서 ③번만이 대화에서 답을 찾을 수 없는 질문이다.

                    빈칸 앞 문장에서 짐은 축구를 좋아하지 않았고, "all the other boys were playing baseball"이라고 말한다. 그리고 빈칸에 이어지는 내용이 "I just wanted to..."이다. 문맥상 다른 아이들이 야구를 하고 있었기 때문에 자신도 그들처럼 되고 싶어서 야구를 시작했다는 의미가 가장 자연스럽다. 실제 원문에도 "be like the other boys"라고 되어 있다.

                    이 문장은 야구를 포기할 생각도 했었다는 질문에 대한 대답이다. 짐 애벗은 포기를 생각했지만 야구를 사랑했기 때문에 계속했다고 말한다. "never say never"는 '절대 포기하지 않는다'는 의미의 관용구로, 진정으로 무언가를 사랑한다면 그것에 대해 '절대 안 된다'고 말하고 싶지 않다는 뜻이다. 즉, 진정한 열정이 있다면 어려움이 있어도 포기하지 않게 된다는 의미를 전달하고 있다.
