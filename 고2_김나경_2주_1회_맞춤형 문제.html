                passage: `Most often, the term “average” indicates the “mean.” It is calculated by adding all the values in a group and ①<u>dividing</u> the result by the number of group members. However, the mean is not the only kind of average. There are two more kinds: the “median” and the “mode.” The median is the number that is exactly in the middle of all the other figures. In this case it is $30,000, because 12 employees are making more than $30,000 and 12 are making less. The mode is the number that ②<u>appears</u> most frequently—$20,000 in this case. As you can see in the illustration, there's only a handful of people that are ③<u>earning</u> an average salary of $57,000 or higher. However, because the company wanted to ④<u>be perceived</u> as a well-paying one, it used the mean, which results in a deceptively high average salary. An average is convincing because it is so simple. To avoid ⑤<u>to be tricked</u>, however, you have to know what sort of average is being reported.`,

If these statistics are found through proper research methods, then they are (A)<u>objective / objectively</u> facts.

In order to look like a well-paying company and to recruit competent candidates, the company decides to distribute a press release that says the average yearly salary of its employees is $57,000, which is quite high. However, the fact is that more than half of its employees earn no more than $30,000 or less a year, and the most common salary for employees is only $20,000. Did the company spread false information? How is this possible? It's because the company used the trap of averages. Averages can show different pictures depending on which type is chosen. To understand the meaning of different types of averages, let's look at the illustration on the next page.`,

For example, a restaurant may put survey cards on the tables, hoping to know what most customers think about its food, service, or atmosphere. However, few cards will be filled out by normal customers, because they don't have any reason to do so. Only those with strongly positive or negative reactions are likely to respond to the survey. This method of choosing a sample is called “voluntary response sampling.” Such samples are biased in favor of strong opinions and underrepresent the moderate ones. Therefore, when you see a statistic, remember that the sample is just as important as the statistic itself.`,

                passage: `The two graphs shown here illustrate how data can be misrepresented. In the first graph, the vertical axis goes all the way up to 100 and all the way down to 0, which makes the decrease in the percentage look modest. In the other graph, only 10 percentage points are shown, from 65 to 75, which makes the change seem much more extreme. Notable is the fact that the two graphs are based on exactly the same data. So, if you want to point out the seriousness of skipping breakfast, you can use the second graph. In fact, you can make nearly any graph more convincing in favor of your argument by cutting off the graph at a certain point.`,
