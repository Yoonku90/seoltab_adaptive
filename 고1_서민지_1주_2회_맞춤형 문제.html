Since it was impossible to build foundations on the oily mud of the polluted land, the architects decided to use old, abandoned boats instead. They were able to purchase these at low prices from the boats' owners. The architects created a small community that includes creative workspaces, studios, meeting rooms, cultural spaces, and even a café, all by upcycling the boats. Then, to connect the boats, wooden paths were built. In addition, special plants that purify polluted soil were planted across the site. Today, some people come to De Ceuvel to test new sustainable technologies such as bio-filters and water reuse systems. Many others come to experience this successful revitalization project in person.`,

Over time, the shipyards closed down, and the work once done at the factories was moved abroad. As a result, the area was left abandoned and polluted for years. Wanting to do something to improve the area, the city purchased an abandoned shipyard called De Ceuvel. However, city officials did not know what to do with it. So they turned to the public for help by asking for plans that would achieve two primary goals. First, the plan had to include a method to clean up the land and turn it into a sustainable development. Second, it had to suggest a way to transform the site into a creative workspace.\n\nQuestion: Why did the city of Amsterdam ask the public for revitalization plans for De Ceuvel?`,
                options: ["Because the city wanted to sell the polluted land to a private architectural company at a high price.", "Because the city lacked a clear vision for how to solve the site's pollution and simultaneously make it a productive space.", "Because the public demanded direct participation in cleaning up the abandoned shipyard and its surrounding factories.", "Because the city's primary goal was to quickly build a new shipyard to bring factory work back from abroad.", "Because the city's budget was only sufficient for purchasing the land, not for developing a concrete plan."],
