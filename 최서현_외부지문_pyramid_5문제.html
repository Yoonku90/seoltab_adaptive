                    지문에서 "Stone was not used for ordinary people's houses since building in stone took a lot of effort"라고 명시되어 있다. 즉, 일반 사람들의 집은 돌로 지어지지 않았으므로 ③번 "일반 사람들의 집도 대부분 돌로 지어졌다"는 내용과 일치하지 않는다. 돌로 건축하는 것은 많은 노력이 필요했기 때문에 일반 사람들의 집에는 사용되지 않았다고 설명하고 있다.

                    이 글은 초기 건물들이 사라진 이유를 설명한 후, 돌로 만들어져 현재까지 남아있는 건축물의 대표적인 예로 기자의 대피라미드를 상세히 소개하고 있다. 피라미드의 건축 시기, 외관, 목적, 의미 등을 구체적으로 설명하고 있으므로 "The Great Pyramid: An Ancient Stone Structure"가 가장 적절한 제목이다. 글의 후반부가 거의 전적으로 대피라미드에 할애되어 있다.

                    지문에는 피라미드를 건설하는 데 사용된 돌의 개수에 대한 정보가 전혀 언급되어 있지 않다. ①번은 썩기 쉬운 재료로 인해 사라졌다고 설명되어 있고, ②번은 돌(stone)이라고 명시되어 있으며, ④번은 파라오의 무덤(tomb)이라고 설명되어 있고, ⑤번은 흰 대리석 층(white marble)으로 덮여 있었다고 설명되어 있다. 따라서 ③번만이 지문에서 답을 찾을 수 없는 질문이다.

                <div class="explanation">
                    빈칸이 있는 문장은 "Stone was not used for ordinary people's houses since building in stone took ________"이다. 돌이 일반 사람들의 집에 사용되지 않은 이유를 설명하는 부분이다. 문맥상 돌로 건축하는 것이 어려웠다는 의미여야 하므로 "a lot of effort"(많은 노력)가 가장 적절하다. 이는 돌 건축이 일반인들에게는 너무 힘든 작업이었음을 나타낸다.

                <div class="explanation">
                    지문의 마지막 문장에서 "This pyramid is one of the most popular attractions in Egypt"라고 되어 있다. 즉, 피라미드는 이집트에서 가장 '인기 있는' 관광 명소 중 하나라고 설명하고 있다. 따라서 ⑤번의 "unpopular"(인기 없는)는 문맥상 반대 의미로 적절하지 않다. "popular"가 올바른 단어이다. 나머지 단어들은 모두 문맥에 적절하게 사용되었다.
